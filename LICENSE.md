pocket-piap-extras-vpn/pocket-piap-extras-vpn.7
pocket-piap-extras-vpn/check_vpn
pocket-piap-extras-vpn/ocserv.conf
pocket-piap-extras-vpn/makefile

However as a bundle including said files and deb file format see resulting copyright file under split licence of GPL2 and modified MIT. This should help to clearly mark where one project ends and the GPL2 affected bundle is.
The intent of this License is not to escape GPL2 content on GPL2 IP rather to allow my oridginal content to be both free here in this state and yet it's core essense (the installed content) to still be usable elsewhere under MIT (sorta like a LGPL but with MIT license).

Note See seperate Licence for deb file format in package licence

Note these extras may also link to projects covered by a LGPL type license.
Notably openconnect server.
